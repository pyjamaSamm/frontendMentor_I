### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I've implemented several HTML and CSS techniques to create a visually appealing component. Some of the key techniques I learned and applied include:

* Proper structuring of HTML elements using tags like div, span, svg, and path.
* Utilization of CSS classes and IDs for targeted styling.
* Implementation of flexbox for flexible and responsive layouts.
* Effective use of positioning, such as margin, padding, and position, to achieve desired element placement.
* Styling elements using various CSS properties like background-color, border-radius, box-shadow, color, font-size, font-weight, and text-align.
* Customizing the visual appearance with linear gradients for background colors.
* Media queries to adapt the layout and styles for different screen sizes.

These techniques allowed me to create an engaging and well-designed component. By exploring and implementing these HTML and CSS features, I have gained valuable knowledge in layout design, responsive development, and the use of custom fonts. Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your requirements.
